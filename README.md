# Popularity-Prediction-and-Recommendation-of-Spotify-Songs
Songs prediction and recommendation is a critical issue for online music service platform and music industry. 
In this project, our goal is to make popularity prediction and recommendation by utilising the dataset from Kaggle of Spotify. We first found the correction 
between songâ€™s features and popularity, then processed the data and finally used different models and features to predict the popularity and recommend songs 
to user according to their personal preference and the popularity we predicted. Experimental results shows that our algorithm is efficient and meaningful in 
this program.
